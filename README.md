This repository contains the experiment scripts for SC2. To prepare your
environment, first [deploy](https://github.com/sc2-sys/deploy) an SC2 cluster,
and upload all the benchmark [applications](https://github.com/sc2-sys/applications).

You may then navigate to any of the different experiments:
* [image-pull](./results/start-up/README.md) - explore different image-pulling mechanisms in SC2.
* [scale-out](./results/scale-out/README.md) - measure the scale-out latency for SC2.
* [start-up](./results/start-up/README.md) - measure the start-up latency for SC2.
